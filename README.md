Assemly language was createded in the early days of computing, assembly usses a short  descriptive word, called mnemonic, an assembler translate the assembly language instructions into machine code


1.3.2

High-level language is a new generration of programming, created in 1950's. They are a platform independent, meaning you can run the language in different machines. Programs written in these high-level language is called source programs or source code.

1.3.4

2. Allocating and assigning system resources 
3 Schduelling operations

1.4.3

Multiprogramming allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by the same CPU
Multithreading allows a single program to execute multile tasks at the same time
Multiprocessing allows multiple programs concurrentlky using multiple processors
